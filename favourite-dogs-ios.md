## Favourite Dogs

Create a new iOS app, the app should have two views:

**Sorting** - a view where users can swipe left or right to move on to the next dog. Swiping right adds the dog to a list of favourite dogs.

**Favourites** - a view where users can see all of their favourite dogs with the option to remove them from their favourites.

Navigating between the views should be achieved via a tab bar controller

There should be no duplicate favourites and all state should be stored locally, so if the user reopens the app all of their favourite fluffy friends should remain.

You can load the random dogs using the following endpoint:

https://random.dog/woof.json

## The tech stack

You are free to select whichever local data storage solution that you find appropriate.

Styling is not the most important part of this test, however if you can make it look nice that would be appreciated.

## Submitting your work

Push your code into a private repository on GitHub, and invite @js1300 with read access. Please make sure you include a clear readme with instructions on how to run your application locally.

Also feel free to include any difficulties or challenge you faced while building out the application.
