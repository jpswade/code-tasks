## Favourite Dogs

Create a new React app with whatever method you prefer. The app should have 2 routes:

`/` - a screen where users can retrieve a random dog image with 2 options underneath. A button to add the dog to their favourites and another to load another random dog.

`/faves` - a screen where users can see all of their favourite dogs with the option to remove them from their favourites

There should be no duplicate favourites and all state should be stored in local storage, so if the user reloads the page all of their favourite fluffy friends should remain.

You can load the random dog images using the following endpoint:

https://random.dog/woof.json

## The tech stack

You can use whatever React routing library you want, however I'd recommend `react-router-dom`.

Styling is not the most important part of this test, however if you can make it look nice that would be appreciated. We use Tailwind a lot internally, so feel free to use it if you want to.

## Submitting your work

Push your code into a private repository on GitHub, and invite @adamcooke and @js1300 with read access. Please make sure you include a clear readme with instructions on how to run your application locally.

Also feel free to include any difficulties or challenges you faced while building out the application.
