# Pricing Form

**Objective:** Create a form which allows the user to select a virtual machine package.

This application is a form which collects information about a customer and allows them to select a particular package.

We have created a design that we would like you to follow when creating this application:

![Price generator form design](/images/price-estimate-design.png)

You can also find these designs [at this Figma url](https://www.figma.com/file/Z0DgMUhRwVrBfOUS62HXJc/katapult-price-estimate-code-test), which should allow you to extract any values you need from the designs, such as color values.

We would like you to follow these designs closely, but to use your initiative when it comes to states that may not be in the designs (for example hover, focus and active states as well as the responsiveness of the application).

The "Generate estimate" submit button doesn't have to perform any sort of POST request as we would like you to focus on the implementation of the provided design.

## The tech stack

Please use whichever tools or libraries you know best.

We know your time is valuable and only want this test to take 1-2 hours, so you can also use any libraries or frameworks you want to speed up the process.

## Submitting your test

Push your code into a private repository on GitHub, and invite @js1300 with read access. Please make sure you include a clear readme with instructions on how to run your application locally.

Also feel free to include any difficulties or challenges you faced while building out the application.
